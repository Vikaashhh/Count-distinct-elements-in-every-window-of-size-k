# 📅 Day 57 – GFG 160 Days DSA Challenge
### 🔍 Problem: Count Distinct Elements in Every Window of Size K
### 🧠 Difficulty: Medium
### 📌 Tags: #Day57 #gfg160 #geekstreak2025
### 🚀 Status: Solved in 1 Attempt ✅

## 📋 Problem Statement:
Given an array and an integer k, determine the count of distinct elements in every contiguous subarray (window) of size k.

## ⚙️ Approach Used: Hash Map + Sliding Window
### 💡 Insight:
We efficiently maintained element frequencies within a moving window using a dictionary (freq).
Key operations:

- Increment frequency of incoming element.

- Decrement and potentially delete the outgoing element if its count drops to 0.

## 📊 Submission Summary:
- ✅ Test Cases Passed: 1111 / 1111

- 🧪 Accuracy: 100%

- ⏱️ Time Taken: 0.13 sec

- 🏆 Points Scored: 4 / 4

- 📈 Total Score: 209

## 🔎 Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(n)

- Space Complexity: O(k)

## 🌱 Key Learning:
Optimized the brute-force approach from O(n*k) to O(n) using frequency hashing and the sliding window paradigm—crucial for real-time stream analysis problems.
